        <h2> About Budgies</hd2>
        <p> Budgies have been kept as pets since the mid-1800s, less than a century after first being spotted by Europeans. British sailors returning from their epic voyage to the east coast of Australia with Captain James Cook in 1770 reported seeing flocks of small green birds in such huge numbers that they blocked out the sun. </p></h2>
